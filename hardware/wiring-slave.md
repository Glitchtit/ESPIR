# Wiring — Slave (Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6)

Battery-powered (LiPo on the BAT pads, charges over USB-C). Transmit-only — no receiver.
There is **no 5 V rail on battery**, so the IR transmitter runs at battery voltage
(~3.7–4.2 V), which reduces range. Add a boost converter only if needed.

## Pin assignments (defaults — override in `menuconfig` → ESPIR Configuration)

| IR TX data | **D10** | GPIO18 | SZHJW `DAT` |
| Power for IR TX | `BAT+` (battery) or `3V3`/`5V` (USB) | — | SZHJW `VCC` |

| **Battery sense** | **A0 / D0** | GPIO0 | divider mid-point (see below) |
| LiPo + | `BAT+` | — | battery + |
| LiPo − | `BAT−` | — | battery − |

```

> On the XIAO ESP32-C6 the pin is silkscreened **D0** — it is the same pin as **A0 / GPIO0**.


## Battery indicator

The firmware reads `A0`/GPIO0, undoes the divider, maps 3.30 V→0 % … 4.20 V→100 %, and reports
**battery %** and **voltage** over the standard Zigbee Power Configuration cluster (0x0001)
every ~10 minutes. Z2M then shows a battery entity (the `ESPIR-SLAVE` converter exposes
`battery` + `battery_voltage`).

- **Recommended: two 55 kΩ** (a 1:2 divider → the default ÷2). Low impedance (~27 kΩ Thévenin),
  so the ESP32 ADC reads it accurately with **no cap needed**. Idle drain ~38 µA — negligible
  for a LiPo. This is what works reliably in practice on GPIO0.
- **Avoid 1 MΩ:1 MΩ here.** Tested on hardware it under-reads even with a 100 nF cap: a 4.0 V
  cell gave 1.68 V at D0 instead of 2.0 V. The pin's tiny DC leakage current loads a divider
  that stiff, dragging the node down; the cap only fixes AC settling, not the DC droop. Keep the
  divider impedance low (tens of kΩ).
- **Different/unequal resistors?** Set the ratio in `menuconfig` → ESPIR Configuration →
  *Battery divider ratio ×100* (`CONFIG_ESPIR_BATTERY_DIV_X100`):
  `(R_top + R_bottom) * 100 / R_bottom`. Example: 55 kΩ:55 kΩ → **200**. Put the *larger*
  resistor on top and keep the divided voltage under ~2.5 V at 4.2 V full so the ADC doesn't clip.
- The ADC pin is `CONFIG_ESPIR_BATTERY_ADC_GPIO` (default 0 = A0); must be an ADC1 pin (GPIO0–6).

## Notes

- A 38–100 µF cap across the SZHJW `VCC`/`GND` is more important here than on the master —
  the LED pulses sag a small LiPo.
- If range is too short for the slave's appliance, add a 3.3 V→5 V boost feeding the SZHJW
  `VCC` (the GPIO still drives `DAT` at 3.3 V — fine for the module's transistor).
- Sleepy End Device: sleep is join-safe and enabled (`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE`). Commands/sends are
  delivered on the next parent poll, so a held send fires a fraction of a second after the master.
- XIAO antenna: GPIO3/GPIO14 select the onboard vs external antenna (handled in firmware;
  see `CONFIG_ESPIR_XIAO_EXT_ANTENNA`). Onboard is the default.

## Custom PCB (XIAO ESP32-C6 as an SMD part)

For a permanent slave you can drop the jumper wires and the SZHJW module entirely: reflow the
XIAO onto a small carrier PCB and build the IR transmitter from discrete parts driven **straight
from GPIO18**. A logic-level N-MOSFET switches two 940 nm LEDs; the SZHJW's internal transistor
is just moved onto your board. The IR/battery **pins are unchanged** — GPIO18 still emits the
38 kHz `DAT` envelope (now into the MOSFET gate), GPIO0 still reads the battery divider. The board
also adds a discrete RGB status LED (see below), so it has its own firmware target, **`slave-pcb/`**
— identical to `slave/` plus the LED. Everything else matches
[the module section above](#pin-assignments-defaults--override-in-menuconfig--espir-configuration).

on-module.

### Status RGB LED

The `slave-pcb/` firmware drives an RGB LED (LEDC PWM on three GPIOs) to show device state:

| State | LED |
|-------|-----|
| Searching for the Zigbee network | amber, slow blink |
| Joined / connected, idle | green, solid — **only while USB-powered** |
| Sending an IR frame | blue, rapid blink |
| On battery, idle | off (green suppressed — see below) |

**Why green is USB-gated:** a steady LED draws a few mA — ~100× the sleepy-ED idle budget — so on
battery the persistent green is suppressed to keep the months-long battery life. The amber-search
and blue-send blinks still run on battery (the CPU is already awake while commissioning or sending).
USB presence is read on a VBUS-sense GPIO; omit that divider (or set `ESPIR_LED_VBUS_GPIO = -1`) to
force the LED always-on at the cost of battery life.

**Driven from `VBAT`, not the 3.3 V GPIO.** Green/blue LED dice have `Vf ≈ 2.9 V` (and up to ~3.4 V
across RGB parts) — at or near a 3.3 V pin, so direct drive leaves them dark or barely lit. Instead each colour is switched
low-side by a small N-MOSFET with the LED's common anode on `VBAT` (~4 V), which gives real
headroom. The MOSFETs keep the firmware **active-high** (GPIO high → FET on → colour on), so
`CONFIG_ESPIR_LED_COMMON_ANODE` stays **n** even though the LED package is common-anode.

| R_r | Red ballast | **470 Ω** — `(4.0−1.85)/470 ≈ 4.6 mA` |
| R_g, R_b | Green/blue ballast | **220 Ω** — `(4.0−2.9)/220 ≈ 5.0 mA` (≈ the LED's 5 mA nominal) |
| R_v1, R_v2 | VBUS-sense divider | **100 kΩ** (top, from `5V`) : **150 kΩ** (bottom) → ~3.0 V |

> Pins recap (custom PCB): IR = D10/GPIO18, batt sense = D0/GPIO0, LED gates = D7/D8/D9, VBUS = D1.
> D2–D6 stay free. Gate pulldowns on Q_r/Q_g/Q_b are optional — LEDC drives the gates low within a
> few ms of boot and holds them low in light sleep; add 100 kΩ gate→GND only to kill boot-flicker.

### Build notes

- **Gate pulldown is not optional on a battery device.** While the XIAO boots or deep-sleeps,
  GPIO18 is high-impedance; R_pd (100 kΩ) keeps Q1 off so the LEDs can't sit half-on and quietly
  drain the cell.
- **Ballast sizing:** `R = (VBAT − Vf − Vds(on)) / I`. With Vf ≈ 1.5 V @ 150 mA and Vds(on) ≈ 0,
  `(4.2 − 1.5) / 0.15 ≈ 18 Ω`. Current tapers to ~100 mA at a 3.3 V cell — range falls gracefully
  with charge. Burst dissipation ≈ 0.15²·18 ≈ 0.4 W peak, ~0.13 W average at 33 % duty, and only
  during the ~300 ms `CONFIG_ESPIR_SEND_HOLD_MS` send window, so a ¼ W part runs cool. To rescale:
  pick your per-LED current `I`, recompute `R`, and confirm `R`'s wattage ≥ `I²·R`. For more LEDs,
  add a parallel `R + LED` leg each (Q1 carries the sum — AO3400A is good for well over 1 A).
- **More range if needed:** the 940 nm emitters are rated 350 mA continuous, so 18 Ω (~150 mA)
  is deliberately conservative for battery life. If the appliance doesn't respond reliably, drop
  the ballast for more reach — ≈10 Ω → ~250 mA or ≈8.2 Ω → ~300 mA per LED — but then use ½ W
  ballasts and a larger `C_res` to feed the bigger (2× peak) bursts without sagging the cell.

  | Ballast | ~Peak / LED | Resistor | Trade-off |
  |---------|-------------|----------|-----------|
  | **18 Ω** | ~150 mA | ¼ W | default — longest battery life |
  | ~10 Ω | ~250 mA | ½ W | more range |
  | ~8.2 Ω | ~300 mA | ½ W | near the 350 mA rating; size `C_res` for the bursts |
- **Reservoir cap** supplies the ~300 mA pulse bursts (2 LEDs × 150 mA) so the small LiPo doesn't
  sag and brown out the XIAO — same reason the SZHJW build wants a cap, more important here.
- **XIAO as SMD:** the module has 2×7 castellated edge pads (2.54 mm pitch) plus two `BAT+`/`BAT−`
  pads on the underside. Reflow on the castellations and add matching pads (or a cutout) under the
  BAT pads on your carrier. Keep the USB-C edge clear of the board outline for charging/flashing.
  Seeed publishes a KiCad/EAGLE "XIAO" footprint you can drop in.
- **Battery connector (J1):** these cells use a **JST 1.25 mm (MX1.25) 2P** plug — a 1.25 mm-pitch
  part, *not* the 2.0 mm JST-PH. Fit the matching MX1.25 header and **check polarity before first
  plug-in**: 1.25 mm LiPo plugs aren't polarity-standardised between vendors, and the XIAO `BAT+`
  pad feeds its charger directly, so a reversed cell can damage the board. Confirm the header's
  `BAT+` pin lines up with the cell's positive lead.
- **On/off switch (SW1):** a slide switch in series in the `BAT+` line, between J1 and the XIAO
  `BAT+` pad. OFF disconnects the cell, so there's **zero battery drain in storage**. It's a battery
  *disconnect*, not a hard kill: the XIAO still runs from USB whenever it's plugged in (its own
  USB-C feeds the regulator), and **charging only happens with SW1 ON** (charge current flows through
  it). A ~300 mA-rated switch is plenty — `C_res` buffers the IR peaks, so SW1 only carries the burst
  *average* (~100–150 mA) plus the XIAO's charge current. Wire common + one throw; leave the third
  pin NC. Put SW1 on the cell side so `C_res`/`C_dec` and the divider all sit on the switched `VBAT`.
- **Still no 5 V on battery**, so the LEDs run at `VBAT` and range is shorter than the 5 V master.
  If that isn't enough, the optional 3.3 V→5 V boost from the Notes above can feed `VBAT` of the
  LED leg (the GPIO/MOSFET gate stays at 3.3 V) — resize R1/R2 for the higher rail.

### Netlist (refdes + nets)

A full connection list for laying out / ERC-checking the board. Refdes use the schematic scheme;
the functional names from the tables above map as: `R1/R2`=IR ballast, `R3`=`Rg`, `R4`=`R_pd`,
`R5/R6`=battery divider, `R7`=`R_r`, `R8`=`R_g`, `R9`=`R_b`, `R10`=`R_v1`, `R11`=`R_v2`,
`C1/C2`=`C_res`, `C3`=`C_dec`, `Q2/Q3/Q4`=`Q_r/Q_g/Q_b` (RGB colour FETs). The RGB LED is
**common-anode** (anode on `VBAT`), switched low-side by Q2/Q3/Q4. SW1 is the on/off slide switch
in series in the `BAT+` line (`VCELL` → `VBAT`). XIAO pin numbers follow the 24-pin module symbol
(`+`/`−` = the bottom `BAT+`/`BAT−` pads).
